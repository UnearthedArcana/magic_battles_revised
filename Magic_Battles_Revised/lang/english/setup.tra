This abjuration causes any spells directed at the caster to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 30 spell levels, meaning it can absorb 30 1st-level spells or 4 spells of 9th level or higher. Having one 'spell level' of protection left means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 9th level spell. This spell will also protect the caster from Dispel/Remove Magic and Breach, while its protection lasts.

This spell absorbs magic effects cast from most scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but will not protect against stationary area-effect spells such as Cloudkill or Stinking Cloud.

Shield of the Archons will block magic attacks under 5th level, such as Spell Thrust and Secret Word. A 6th-level or higher spell, such as Pierce Magic, is required to dispel it.

When this spell is cast, it will dispel one spell protection on all enemies within the area of effect. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on a target first. If a target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

The spell protections dispelled by Spell Thrust include: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen and Spell Shield.

This spell creates a faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Fourth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe.

Saving Throw: vs. Spells

When a Secret Word spell is uttered, it will dispel two layers of spell protections on the target. Thus, it will remove a Spell Deflection and a Minor Spell Deflection, or a Minor Spell Protection and a Globe of Invulnerability, et cetera. This will always dispel the highest-level spell protection on the target (affecting up to 7th-level protection spells). Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

Additionally, a Secret Word has an "ear worm" quality which can unbalance the target and make spellcasting difficult. This is similar to the effect of Deafness, imposing a 50% chance of casting failure for one round on a failed save vs. spells. This effect can occur regardless of any spell deflections or level-based immunity the target may have.

The spell protections dispelled by Secret Word include: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Globe of Invulnerability, and Greater Spell Deflection.

Secret Word will not dispel any spell protections on a target protected by Spell Trap or Shield of the Archons. A Spell Shield will block Secret Word from dispelling any protections, though the Spell Shield itself will be fully consumed in the effort.

This abjuration causes any spells directed at the caster to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 9 spell levels, meaning it can absorb nine 1st-level spells or one spell of 9th level or higher. Having one 'spell level' of protection left means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 9th level spell. This spell will also protect the caster from Dispel/Remove Magic and Breach, while its protection lasts.

Casting this spell will automatically create a Minor Spell Deflection, per the 3rd-level spell, in addition to the Spell Deflection. The Minor Deflection will not afford the caster additional 'spell levels' of protection - those from the lesser Deflection will be used up at the same time as those of this spell - but both Deflection effects will protect the caster independently when they are subjected to magic attacks like Spell Thrust or Pierce Magic.

This spell absorbs magic effects cast from most scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but will not protect against stationary area-effect spells such as Cloudkill or Stinking Cloud.

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd- or 4th-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Fifth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by abjurative forms of magical attack such as Pierce Magic and Spellstrike.

When this spell is cast upon a target creature there will be three effects. First, the target's Magic Resistance, if any, will be nullified and set to zero for two rounds. This occurs regardless of any spell deflections or level-based immunity the target may have.

This abjuration causes any spells directed at the caster to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 18 spell levels, meaning it can absorb eighteen 1st-level spells or two spells of 9th level or higher. Having one 'spell level' of protection left means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 9th level spell. This spell will also protect the caster from Dispel/Remove Magic and Breach, while its protection lasts.

Casting this spell will automatically create a Minor Spell Deflection and a Spell Deflection in addition to the Greater Spell Deflection. The lesser Deflection effects will not afford the caster additional 'spell levels' of protection - those from the lesser Deflections will be used up at the same time as those of this spell - but all three Deflection effects will independently protect the caster when they are subjected to magic attacks like Spell Thrust or Pierce Magic.

This spell absorbs magic effects cast from most scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but will not protect against stationary area-effect spells such as Cloudkill or Stinking Cloud.

Casting this spell will automatically raise an additional Spell Deflection and Minor Spell Deflection.

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: vs. Spells

When a Ruby Ray of Reversal is directed at a target, it will dispel three layers of spell protections on the target. Thus, it will dispel Greater Spell Deflection, Spell Deflection, and Minor Spell Deflection; or Greater Spell Deflection, Spell Deflection, and Globe of Invulnerability; et cetera. This will always dispel the highest-level spell protection on the target. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

Additionally, A Ruby Ray is capable of destroying a Spell Trap, the most powerful spell protection. In this case, the Ruby Ray is consumed and will not remove any lesser spell protections.

Finally, the searing light of the Ruby Ray can blind the target for one round, and this effect can occur regardless of any spell protections the target may have. A successful saving throw vs. spells at a -2 penalty will negate this effect.

The spell protections dispelled by Ruby Ray of Reversal include: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Shield of the Archons, and Spell Trap.

A Spell Shield will block Ruby Ray of Reversal from dispelling any protections, though the Spell Shield itself will be fully consumed in the effort.

Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast on the target creature, it will dispel two layers of spell protections on the taret, similar to the effect of Secret Word. Thus, it will remove a Spell Deflection and a Minor Spell Deflection, or a Minor Spell Protection and a Globe of Invulnerability, et cetera.

Then, this effect will be repeated twice: one round later and two round later. In each case, the Warding Whip will dispel either two spell protections or a Spell Shield. Every round thereafter, until the duration of the spell expires, another two layers of spell protections or one Spell Shield will be removed. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first (affecting up to 8th-level protection spells). The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.

The spell protections dispelled by Spell Thrust include: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Globe of Invulnerability, and Greater Spell Deflection. 

A Spell Shield will block one application of the Warding Whip, though the Spell Shield itself will be fully consumed in the effort and subsequent repetitions will continue to occur.

This immensely powerful abjuration combines two capabilities. First, it acts as a spell protection, allowing the caster to ignore the effects of *any* spells cast at or near <PRO_HIMHER>. In this regard it could be considered a one-way Anti-Magic Shell, or a supreme version of a Globe of Invulnerability, blocking all spell effects of levels one through nine. Second, the Spell Trap acts like a powerful Spell Shield, blocking magic attacks such as Spell Thrust or Pierce Magic from dispelling any of the caster's lesser spell protections. Only after the Spell trap is removed by a Ruby Ray of Reversal or Pierce Shield can enemies begin to remove other protections such as Spell Deflections.
